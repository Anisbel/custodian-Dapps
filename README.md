This is a an implementation of a Third-Party Decentralized Custodians that act as an intermediary between a fund manager and an investment bank. Under this approach, the investment bank never handles clients securities/collaterals. Under specific rules that are accepted by both parties, a margin call can be triggered to tell the client to post more collateral. If the client doesnt meet the criteria for this margin call, the lender can trigger a liquidation process that can liquidate all the securities. 


Futur improvement : implement a Tri-party custodians that will handle optimization of collaterals to be posted
